Several temporary files are generated in the process and stored in directory `scratch/`. They correspond to the statistics about within-collection and between-collection comparisons. They are not versioned in this repository for being too many or too big, but ZIP archives are available from the [releases page](https://github.com/julian-urbano/sigir2019-standardization/releases/tag/scratch).

* `01-within.zip` contains all within-collection comparisons.
* `02-between.zip` contains all between-collection comparisons.
